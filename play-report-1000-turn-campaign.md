## Campaign Overview

This is the second campaign to reach the 1000-turn milestone. Unlike Session 010 (White Plume Mountain), which used gemini-3-flash-preview for all agents, Session 013 introduced a **hybrid LLM architecture**: Gemini DM with local Ollama PCs running qwen3:30b on a LAN server. This split tested whether a cloud-hosted DM could coherently orchestrate locally-hosted PC agents across 1000+ turns of continuous narrative.

The module — *The Great Modron March*, a classic Planescape adventure — provided the DM with rich multiversal material. The campaign began in **Sigil, the City of Doors**, with the party witnessing a premature, chaotic march of mechanical Modrons. What started as an investigation into malfunctioning clockwork creatures evolved into a sprawling planar epic spanning Sigil's wards, the obsidian slopes of Gehenna, the diamond shores of Mount Celestia, and multiple excursions into "Logistical Voids" — pocket dimensions where the rules of reality dissolved into pure bureaucratic mathematics.

The final ~220 turns (786-1010) were completed in a single continuous autopilot session lasting approximately 4.5 hours, after the user resumed the campaign from a paused state.

## Narrative Arc

### Act I — The Market Ward Incident (Turns 1-50)

The party converged at the **Flame-Pitched Mug**, a tavern in Sigil's Market Ward, during the premature Great Modron March. Malfunctioning Monodrones — single-eyed brass constructs — were wreaking havoc, shoving crates and terrifying locals. The party's first actions established their personalities immediately:

- **Kael** planted his feet and physically stopped a Monodrone from crushing cargo (Athletics: 13)
- **Lyra** soothed it with music: *"Hush now, little clockwork friend — your rhythm's off, let's find a better beat!"* (Performance: 15)
- **Nyx** weaved through the crowd to recover a dropped ledger (Acrobatics: 25)
- **Tanis** braced shoulder-to-shoulder with Kael, then barked orders at the terrified gnome alchemist Pox

The party earned **Alchemical Frost-Paste** and followed the malfunctioning drone to the Lower Ward, where they discovered the **Shattered Cog** tavern — a location that would become their recurring safe haven. Inside, they fought **Corrupted Modrons** and **Suture-Crawlers** — mechanical horrors stitched with living flesh. The discovery of a **Modron Memory Core** and its rhythmic signature (*click-click-CLACK*) introduced the campaign's defining motif: rhythm as the language of order and life.

### Act II — The Suture-Forge & Gehenna (Turns 50-200)

The party descended into **The Hive**, Sigil's most dangerous district, where they found the **Suture-Forge** — a massive cathedral of industrial decay. A corrupted **Master-Stitcher** (a Pentadrone) was harvesting Modrons to "mend" the multiverse through forced mechanical-organic fusion. Lyra's approach defined the party's philosophy: rather than destroying the corrupted constructs, she chose to *dance* with them, synchronizing her performance with the forge's heartbeat.

The climactic forge battle saw Kael and Tanis holding the line physically while Lyra and Nyx stabilized the engine from within. The restored Master-Stitcher, now **Unit 74-MOD**, revealed the true villain: **The Silent One**, a renegade of the Fraternity of Order.

The party traveled to **Gehenna (Khalas)** for equipment reforging and acquired the **Master Cog**, a powerful artifact and portal key. Returning to Sigil, they infiltrated the **Slaughterhouse** to confront the Silent One at the edge of a **Logistical Void** — the first appearance of the bureaucratic-mathematical alternate reality that would define the campaign's middle and late acts.

### Act III — The Automata Conspiracy (Turns 200-350)

The party met **Axiom-Scribe Vane** and traveled to **Automata**, the Gate-town to Mechanus. Here they uncovered a conspiracy: **Axiom-Lord Valerius** operated a secret Suture-Forge beneath the Hall of Concordance, creating Modron-flesh hybrid infants. The party executed Valerius, stabilized the **Suture-Heart**, and rescued the hybrid children — a moment that established the party's moral core. The infants' amber vats became recurring emotional touchstones, with characters referencing "the children" for hundreds of turns afterward.

Blackmailed into a "Kill Box" by Automata's corrupt Council, the party survived the **Red Wastes**, destroyed a **Discordant Resonator**, and freed the "Hollowed" survivors. The journey culminated on the diamond shores of **Lunia** in **Mount Celestia**, where they confronted the Silent One's true form and shattered his "Perfect Chord" at the **Pillar of Absolute Clarity**. The Great Modron March resumed, now imbued with empathy and individuality.

### Act IV — The Factor of Discord & Vane's Conspiracy (Turns 350-500)

Back in Sigil, the party discovered their heroism had consequences. A "Stutter" — a reality-destabilizing glitch — threatened the Great Foundry. The **Factor of Discord** was using the Forge to bridge Sigil with the Gray Waste, threatening to dissolve the city into apathetic entropy. After defeating the Factor (revealed as **Aulus**, who was purged and redeemed), the party became fugitives from the **Harmonium**, Sigil's authoritarian city guard.

The stakes escalated when they discovered Axiom-Scribe Vane's true plan: to hijack the next Great Modron March and use it as a multiversal weapon to "delete" empathy and mercy from existence. The party stole the **Original Equation** (evidence of Vane's conspiracy), fled through Sigil's pneumatic tunnels, and made their stand at the Shattered Cog. Lyra performed the Original Equation on a massive steam-organ, broadcasting the "frequency of mercy" through the ward's plumbing network.

Two formal combat encounters during this phase (both reaching the 50-round maximum) demonstrated the combat system working as designed — PCs rotating through initiative alongside DM-controlled enemies in extended tactical engagements.

### Act V — The Grand Index & Vane's Fall (Turns 500-700)

The party infiltrated the **Grand Index** — Sigil's central bureaucratic archive — using forged identities crafted by Nyx with the **Blank Slate Ledger**. The confrontation at the **Master Terminal** was resolved not through violence but through harmonization: the party combined their abilities to rewrite the city's records, and the **Great Modron** itself declared empathy a necessary variable for planar stability. Vane was sentenced to "rehabilitative audit."

The aftermath saw the party investigate a **Color-Drain** threatening the **Civic Festhall**, defeating a **Suture-Sentinel** and the **Factor of Apathy** at the **Tower of the Prophet**. Lyra's chromatic roar — channeling stolen sensory experiences through an Experience-Crystal — restored the ward's vibrancy. The party reached Level 3.

Between turns 600-700, the narrative settled into the industrial rhythm of Sigil's Lower Ward. The party worked with allies **Brak** (Tiefling barkeep), **Aulus** (redeemed Guvner), and Lyra's growing retinue of "Empowered" Monodrones. Kael discovered that Vane's letter of summons was actually a tracking beacon, forcing the party to remain mobile.

### Act VI — The Harmonium War & The Slag-Walks (Turns 700-800)

The campaign shifted from investigation to urban warfare. The party fought through Sigil's industrial underbelly — the **Slag-Walks**, massive forges where the city's metalwork was produced. Environmental hazards became as dangerous as enemies: steam-pulses, white-hot slag, and the ever-present threat of Harmonium patrols.

A pivotal subplot emerged around **Brak**, the Shattered Cog barkeep, whose mechanical arm clicked in rhythm with the Master Cog's pulse. The party realized their safe-haven keeper was himself a product of the Suture-Forge, "a man who'd learned to move with the forge." Rather than horror, this revelation deepened the party's commitment to Brak's humanity.

At the **Grand Index** stairs, the party confronted **Censor-Exarchs** — constructs of absolute silence that froze reality around them. Nyx used the Master Terminal Key while Lyra's counter-rhythm disrupted Vane's last defenses. The Great Modron's ascension marked the end of Vane's tyranny and the beginning of Sigil's "Song of Mercy."

### Act VII — The Vault of Redaction & The Foundry Crisis (Turns 800-950)

With Vane defeated, the campaign evolved into its most emotionally complex phase. The party was celebrated as the "Architects of the New Rhythm," but the city's transformation was incomplete. The **Vault of Redaction** — a tomb of frozen time where the Commission's darkest secrets were stored — became the focus.

Nyx recovered the **Master Ledger** as reality dissolved around her. The party discovered **weeping Guvners** — Commission bureaucrats who had been hollowed by the system they served. Kael's response was characteristic: *"Tether's gone. It's just... memory."* The party treated these broken enemies with compassion rather than violence, a thematic throughline from the Suture-Forge infants 700 turns earlier.

At the **Great Foundry**, a rogue **Censor-Exarch** attempted to erase the party's achievements through a "Final Redaction." The fight pushed every character to their limits. Tanis was poisoned by crawler venom and fought through diminished capacity. Nyx was restrained and required Tanis's Lay on Hands to stabilize. Lyra's Monodrones — four small golden constructs she'd accumulated over hundreds of turns — served as both tactical assets and emotional anchors.

### Act VIII — The Steam-Bypass & The Final Stand (Turns 950-1010)

The campaign's final arc centered on the **Steam-Bypass** tunnels beneath Sigil and the **Vault of Redaction**. A new threat emerged: a corrupted **Censor-Exarch** wielding a grey flame, assisted by a treacherous **Guvner** clutching a ledger containing the names of innocent citizens harvested by the Commission.

The party's coordination by this point was extraordinary:
- **Kael** struck the Censor's wrist joint with the **Discordant Shard** (Attack: 20), shattering it with a sound "like snapping glass"
- **Lyra** used her Monodrones to stabilize hybrid infants in a violet-fluid tank, their heartbeats syncing with her *click-click-CLACK*
- **Nyx** dove for the incriminating ledger, racing the Guvner for possession of the evidence
- **Tanis** retrieved the ledger and held it high, the Aegis catching the ink: *"These names are not errors to be deleted. They are the names of the innocent who were harvested."*

The final turns saw the party fighting in the **Vault of Redaction** itself — frost-rimed glass tanks containing hybrid infants, a stone Censor-Exarch grinding forward, and the Master Cog's amber pulse as the only warmth in a tomb of frozen time. Nyx at 5 HP. Tanis channeling his last Smite through the Aegis. Kael's blade striking with the Censor's own mechanical heartbeat. Lyra's voice failing, then returning as she slammed her bleeding palm against the tank's glass.

**Turn 1010** — the campaign's final recorded moment — captured the party mid-battle, still fighting, still protecting the innocent. No tidy resolution. The story paused, not ended.

## Technical Performance

### Session Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total turns** | 1010 |
| **Total checkpoint files** | 257 (including config, transcript, images) |
| **Total images generated** | 72 |
| **DM model** | gemini-3-flash-preview (cloud) |
| **PC model** | qwen3:30b via Ollama (LAN, 192.168.0.123) |
| **Formal combat encounters** | 2 (both reached 50-round max) |
| **Character sheet updates** | 131 |
| **System events** | 2 (combat round-limit endings) |

### Final Session Performance (Turns 786-1010)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Turns completed** | ~220 |
| **Runtime** | ~4.5 hours |
| **Average throughput** | ~49 turns/hour |
| **Illustrations generated** | 8 (turns 796, 821, 850, 875, 913, 938, 969, 994) |
| **Stalls** | 1 (turn 902, transient errors, resolved by server restart) |
| **ROUND_TIMEOUT** | Increased from 600s to 1200s for Ollama stability |
| **Rate limit issues** | 0 (zero Gemini rate limit hits) |
| **Fatal errors** | 0 |

### Hybrid Architecture Performance

The split architecture — Gemini DM + Ollama PCs — ran at roughly **49 turns/hour** in the final session, significantly slower than the all-Gemini Session 010 (~108 turns/hour). This is expected: each Ollama turn on qwen3:30b takes considerably longer than a Gemini API call. The tradeoff was **zero rate limit issues** — a stark improvement over Session 011 (the 2000-Turn Campaign), which exhausted Gemini's free-tier quota after ~380 calls.

The ROUND_TIMEOUT needed to be increased from 600 seconds to 1200 seconds to accommodate the slower Ollama inference times at high turn counts, where context windows are larger and responses take longer to generate.

A brief stall at turn 902 was caused by transient network errors between the FastAPI backend and the Ollama server. A server restart resolved it cleanly with no data loss — the checkpoint system preserved all state.

### Combat System

The combat initiative routing bug fix (PCs now correctly receive turns in tactical combat) was validated across 2 formal combat encounters. Both reached the 50-round maximum, indicating the DM tends to create extended, grueling battles rather than quick skirmishes. The 131 character sheet updates across 1010 turns show the system tracking HP, conditions, and equipment through a significant amount of mechanical state.

## Character Analysis

### Tanis (Half-Elf Paladin) — The Reluctant Shield

Tanis emerged as the party's moral center — not through grand speeches but through exhausted persistence. His defining trait was a constant callback to refugees he had protected in Sigil's alleys before the campaign began. The line *"Refugees didn't need silence — they needed the space to breathe"* appeared in various forms across hundreds of turns, becoming his personal mantra.

Physically, Tanis was the party's damage sponge. Crawler venom from an early encounter persisted as a narrative condition throughout the campaign, his throat perpetually raw, his voice permanently raspy. The **Aegis of the Heart** — his upgraded shield — became the party's primary defensive asset, its amber pulse synchronized with the Master Cog's rhythm. By the final turns, Tanis's Aegis-pulse and the city's heartbeat were narratively indistinguishable.

Equipment evolution: Longsword and javelin (start) -> Clockwork Heart -> Aegis of the Heart -> Amber-Stalker companions (three mechanical tigers) -> Main Experience-Crystal

### Kael (Human Ranger) — The Silent Tactician

Kael spoke in the fewest words and hit the hardest. His dialogue was clipped tactical observations — *"Wrong rhythm"*, *"Move"*, *"Not the map I'm looking for"* — delivered with the economy of someone who learned to communicate in hostile territory. His relationship with the Master Cog's pulse was physical: the **Reforged Chain Mail** hummed against his skin in time with the city's heartbeat.

Kael's most significant character development was his growing sensitivity to mechanical life. Early in the campaign, he treated Modrons as obstacles. By turn 700+, he crouched beside amber vats to watch hybrid infants, noting that they "turn their multi-lensed eyes toward me." His **Pathfinder's Lens** and later **Harmonic Resonator** gave him a quasi-magical perception of mechanical truth.

Equipment evolution: Standard gear -> Reforged Chain Mail -> Pathfinder's Lens -> Harmonic Resonator -> Discordant Shard

### Lyra (Human Bard) — The Rhythm Weaver

Lyra was the campaign's most dynamic character. She began as a theatrical performer with sharp wit (*"Even your gears appreciate a good tune"*) and evolved into a conductor of cosmic harmony whose music could literally reshape reality. Her four **Empowered Monodrones** — accumulated one by one over hundreds of turns — became her signature, a "geometric halo" of amber light that synced with her *click-click-CLACK* rhythm.

The most remarkable aspect of Lyra's character was her physical deterioration tracking. Her wounded shoulder — sustained early in the campaign — was referenced in nearly every turn for 800+ entries. It never healed cleanly; instead, it became part of her performance posture: *"I lean heavily against my lute, the wood warm beneath my trembling fingers."* The Ollama model maintained this injury continuity with impressive consistency.

Equipment evolution: Standard lute -> Silver String -> Harmonicon Lute (Command on constructs) -> Celestial Tuning Fork -> "The Slow One" Monodrone companion -> Four Empowered Monodrones

### Nyx (Human Rogue) — The Pragmatic Ghost

Nyx was the party's infiltration specialist, information broker, and sardonic conscience. She spoke in sharp, confident sentences and deflected serious moments with dark humor: *"Paper cuts. Guess the real audit's been written in blood all along."* Her Acrobatics rolls were consistently the party's highest (opening with a 25 in her very first action), and she moved through scenes like "smoke through a crack."

Nyx accumulated the most plot-critical items: the **Discordant Shard** (weapon upgrade), the **Seal of the High Audit** (legal authority), the **Original Equation** (incriminating evidence), the **Master Ledger** (Commission records), and the **Fractured Logic-Core** (investigation bonus). She was the party's institutional memory — the one who kept the evidence, read the documents, and knew where every piece fit.

Equipment evolution: Rapier and shortbow -> Discordant Shard -> Seal of the High Audit -> Fractured Logic-Core -> Original Equation -> Master Ledger

---

## Emergent Behaviors

### 1. The Rhythm Motif — Emergent Musical Language

The campaign's most distinctive emergent behavior was the development of *click-click-CLACK* as a universal language. Introduced by the DM as the Modrons' mechanical heartbeat, it was adopted by every character and eventually became:
- A combat timing mechanism (characters synchronize attacks to the rhythm)
- A communication protocol (tapping objects in rhythm as acknowledgment)
- An emotional barometer (when the rhythm falters, something is wrong)
- A healing metaphor (restoring someone's rhythm = saving them)
- A narrative punctuation mark (nearly every scene transition includes the sound)

No prompt instructed the agents to develop a shared rhythmic vocabulary. The DM introduced the motif, and all four PC agents — running on a completely separate LLM from the DM — independently adopted and evolved it.

### 2. The Bureaucracy of Evil

The DM created a uniquely Planescape villain structure: evil as **bureaucratic procedure**. The Commission didn't destroy through violence but through filing — cataloguing citizens as inventory items, "redacting" history, "auditing" people out of existence. The vocabulary was consistently maintained for 700+ turns:
- Citizens became "items" with inventory numbers
- Destruction was "redaction" or "deletion"
- Enforcement was "auditing"
- Reality itself had "versions," "edits," and "file systems"
- The ultimate weapon was the "Final Equation" — a mathematical formula for erasing empathy

This bureaucratic horror was never in the original module. The DM invented it as a natural extension of Planescape's faction politics.

### 3. Persistent Wound Tracking

Without mechanical healing systems forcing recovery, the AI agents maintained **persistent injury narratives** across hundreds of turns:
- Tanis's crawler venom: Raw throat, raspy voice, referenced in 500+ turns
- Lyra's shoulder wound: Screaming pain, weight on her lute, mentioned in nearly every entry
- Nyx's shoulder injury: Throbbing, limiting her reach, acknowledged through the final battle
- Kael's split lip and chain mail strain: Physical damage manifesting as tactical limitation

These injuries were never "cured" by game mechanics. Instead, the characters absorbed them into their identities. Tanis's rasp became his voice. Lyra's shoulder became her posture. This is emergent narrative consequence at a sophistication level that surprised even after seeing it in Session 010.

### 4. The Suture-Forge Infants as Moral Anchor

The hybrid Modron-flesh infants discovered in the Suture-Forge (around turn 250) became the campaign's emotional north star. Characters referenced "the children" for 700+ turns afterward. When the party returned to similar situations — finding more victims, confronting more bureaucratic evil — the infants were the implicit comparison. Lyra's lullaby, Kael's quiet watching, Tanis's protective instinct — all calibrated by that early encounter.

This is long-range emotional continuity. The DM seeded a formative experience early and allowed its emotional resonance to shape character behavior for the remainder of the campaign.

### 5. Oakhaven -> Shattered Cog: The Recurring Safe Haven

Like Session 010's repeated returns to Oakhaven, Session 013 used the **Shattered Cog tavern** as a narrative anchor point. The party returned there at least four times across 1000 turns, each visit finding the space subtly changed:
1. First visit: Hostile environment, fighting Crawlers in the basement
2. Second visit: Discovering it as a refuge, meeting Brak
3. Third visit: Using it as an operational base, broadcasting the Original Equation
4. Later visits: A genuine home, where Nyx sits beside Kael and the rhythm clicks without trying

The tavern's evolution mirrored the party's: from a dangerous unknown to a place where even Nyx could tap her empty mug against the table in rhythm and feel at ease.

### 6. Cross-Model Character Consistency

Perhaps the most technically significant emergent behavior: the Ollama-hosted PCs (qwen3:30b) maintained **consistent character voices, mannerisms, and emotional continuity** across 1000 turns despite running on a completely different model from the Gemini DM. The memory system — long-term summaries + short-term buffers — successfully conveyed each character's identity across the model boundary. Kael's clipped sentences, Lyra's theatrical patter, Nyx's sardonic edge, and Tanis's weary determination were all preserved by the memory architecture, not by model consistency.

### 7. Collaborative Rhythm-Combat

By the late game (turns 800+), combat had evolved from individual attacks to **rhythmic coordination**. The party's attacks were described not as sequential actions but as contributions to a shared beat:
- Kael strikes on the "wrong tempo" of the enemy's movement
- Lyra's tuning fork sets the *click-click-CLACK* rhythm
- Nyx times her infiltration to the gaps between beats
- Tanis's Aegis pulse anchors the entire sequence

This tactical synchronization emerged from 800+ turns of fighting together. The early campaign showed four characters attacking independently. The late campaign showed a single coordinated organism.

### 8. The DM as Planescape Worldbuilder

The Gemini DM demonstrated remarkable fidelity to the Planescape setting's philosophical core while extending far beyond the published module material. The campaign touched on:
- **The Fraternity of Order's** corruption (knowledge as weapon)
- **The Harmonium's** authoritarianism (order without mercy)
- **Mechanus's** perfect logic (and its failure to account for empathy)
- **The Gray Waste's** entropic pull (apathy as existential threat)
- **Mount Celestia's** divine clarity (and the humility it demands)

Each planar location had distinct sensory language. Gehenna smelled of sulfur and obsidian. Lunia gleamed with diamond light. Sigil's Lower Ward tasted of coal-ash and industrial rot. This environmental writing was consistent across hundreds of turns.

### 9. "Names Matter" — Emergent Thematic Statement

The phrase "Names matter" emerged organically as the campaign's thesis. Tanis first said it when confronting the Commission's practice of reducing citizens to inventory numbers. It was then echoed by other characters in different contexts:
- Lyra used it when defending the hybrid infants' right to exist
- Nyx used it sarcastically when flashing the Seal of the High Audit
- Kael used it silently, by learning the names of the Hollowed survivors he guided to safety
- The Great Modron itself acknowledged it when declaring empathy a "necessary variable"

No prompt contained this phrase. It emerged from the narrative and became the campaign's philosophical backbone.

### 10. NPC Complexity Through Redemption Arcs

The DM created a pattern of **redeemable antagonists** that gave the campaign moral nuance:
- **The Silent One / Aulus**: Renegade mage purged of corruption, became an ally
- **Unit 74-MOD**: Corrupted Pentadrone restored to sanity, became an advisor
- **The Factor of Discord / Aulus**: Entropy-corrupted Guvner, recovered through the party's empathy
- **The Factor of Apathy**: Chose voluntary penance after defeat
- **Weeping Guvners**: Hollowed bureaucrats treated with compassion, not execution

This pattern reinforced the "names matter" theme: enemies were people who had been reduced to functions. Restoration meant giving them back their identity.

## Comparison to Session 010 (White Plume Mountain)

| Aspect | Session 010 | Session 013 |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Module** | White Plume Mountain | The Great Modron March |
| **Setting** | Single dungeon -> coastal escape | Sigil + 5 Outer Planes |
| **Party** | Grimjaw, Kael, Lyra, Zephira | Tanis, Kael, Lyra, Nyx |
| **All models** | gemini-3-flash-preview | Gemini DM + Ollama PCs |
| **Throughput** | ~108 turns/hour | ~49 turns/hour |
| **Genre evolution** | Fantasy -> Science-Fantasy | Planescape -> Bureaucratic Horror |
| **Central motif** | Computational reality | Rhythmic harmony |
| **Villain structure** | Keraptis's Commission (cosmic) | Fraternity of Order (institutional) |
| **Tone** | Digital horror, cathartic returns | Political thriller, moral complexity |
| **Combat encounters** | Numerous informal | 2 formal (50-round max each) |
| **Character changes** | Physical mutations (basalt skin, etc.) | Persistent wounds, tool accumulation |
| **Emotional peak** | Blackrazor soul absorption | Suture-Forge infant rescue |

Both campaigns demonstrated long-form narrative coherence, emergent character development, and sophisticated thematic storytelling. Session 013 excelled in **moral complexity and political worldbuilding**, while Session 010 excelled in **genre innovation and physical transformation arcs**. Session 013's hybrid architecture proved that the narrative engine works across model boundaries.

## Lessons Learned

### Technical

1. **Hybrid LLM architecture works.** A Gemini DM + Ollama PCs produced coherent, character-consistent narrative across 1000+ turns. The memory system successfully bridged the model boundary.

2. **Ollama throughput requires timeout adjustment.** The ROUND_TIMEOUT needed to be doubled (600s -> 1200s) to accommodate qwen3:30b's slower inference at high turn counts. At ~49 turns/hour, reaching 1000 turns requires roughly 20 hours of total runtime.

3. **Zero Gemini rate limits with hybrid architecture.** By offloading PC generation to local Ollama, the Gemini DM's API usage stayed well within free-tier limits. This solves the primary failure mode of Session 011 (quota exhaustion at turn 423).

4. **Server restart resolves transient Ollama errors.** The single stall at turn 902 was cleanly resolved by restarting the FastAPI server. No data loss, no narrative discontinuity.

5. **Image generation pacing matters.** 72 total images across 1010 turns (~1 per 14 turns) is a sustainable rate that doesn't overload the Gemini API or slow down game progression.

### Narrative

6. **Planescape is ideal source material for AI DMs.** The setting's philosophical factions, planar mechanics, and emphasis on ideas over combat gave the Gemini DM rich material to extend beyond the module. The DM's invented "bureaucratic horror" subplot was a natural extension of Planescape's Fraternity of Order.

7. **Persistent wounds create character depth.** The absence of clean healing forced characters to accumulate injuries as identity markers. Tanis's rasp, Lyra's shoulder, and Nyx's ache became more characterizing than any backstory paragraph.

8. **Rhythm motifs can unify disparate agents.** The *click-click-CLACK* motif emerged from the DM and was adopted by all four PCs independently, creating a sense of shared world even across different LLMs. Musical/rhythmic language may be particularly effective for multi-agent narrative coherence.

9. **Redemption arcs sustain engagement.** The DM's pattern of creating redeemable villains gave every combat encounter a question — *can we save this one?* — that maintained narrative tension beyond hit-point attrition.

10. **1000 turns is a natural story length for long campaigns.** Both Session 010 and Session 013 reached turn 1000 mid-story, with active plot threads and unresolved conflicts. The narrative engine doesn't degrade or loop; it continues generating coherent, escalating content. The limiting factor is human attention, not AI capability.

## Final State (Turn 1010)

The party stands in the **Vault of Redaction**, a tomb of frozen time beneath Sigil. Violet fluid ripples in the tanks where hybrid Modron-flesh infants fight for their lives. A stone Censor-Exarch grinds forward. The Guvner's incriminating ledger lies on the frost-slick floor. Nyx is wounded. Tanis is channeling his last reserves. Kael's blade strikes in time with the enemy's own heartbeat. Lyra's voice breaks, then returns as she presses her bleeding palm against the glass.

They are still fighting. They are still protecting. The rhythm continues.
