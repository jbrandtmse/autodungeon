**Multi-agent D&D game engine where AI plays Dungeons & Dragons together.**

*"Nostalgia for D&D, made accessible for people who can't coordinate 4 friends."*

---

## What is autodungeon?

autodungeon creates a self-playing D&D party where multiple AI agents roleplay as adventurers while another AI runs the game as Dungeon Master. You can watch the adventure unfold like a living story, or drop in at any moment to take control of a character.

**The Problem:** Millions of adults who grew up playing D&D have been forced to abandon the hobby—not because they lost interest, but because coordinating 4+ schedules is nearly impossible in modern life.

**The Solution:** AI agents that play D&D together, creating emergent collaborative storytelling on your schedule.

### Key Features

- **Watch Mode** - AI party plays autonomously; watch the story unfold
- **Drop-In Mode** - Take control of any character at any moment, then leave when you want
- **True Party Dynamics** - Multiple LLMs interact as distinct characters with independent memories
- **Emergent Storytelling** - Improv principles ("Yes, and...") create genuine surprises
- **Full Transcript Logging** - Research-ready logs for studying multi-agent narrative behavior

## Project Status

**Status: In Development**

This project has completed comprehensive planning and architecture design. Implementation is underway.

See the [planning artifacts](_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/) for:
- [Product Requirements Document](_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/prd.md) - 55 functional requirements
- [Architecture Decisions](_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md) - Technical design choices
- [Epic/Story Breakdown](_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md) - Implementation roadmap

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- API keys for at least one LLM provider (Gemini, Claude, or Ollama for local)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jbrandtmse/autodungeon.git
cd autodungeon

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Copy environment template and add your API keys
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Run the application
streamlit run app.py
```

### Configuration

- **API Keys**: Set in `.env` file
- **Game Defaults**: `config/defaults.yaml`
- **Characters**: `config/characters/*.yaml`

## Architecture Overview

autodungeon uses a **supervisor pattern** where the DM agent orchestrates turns:

```
┌─────────────────┐
│ Context Manager │ ← Monitors memory, triggers summarization
└────────┬────────┘
         ▼
    ┌─────────┐
    │ DM Turn │ ← Narrates, controls NPCs, routes to next agent
    └────┬────┘
         ▼
  ┌──────────────┐
  │ PC Turn(s)   │ ← Each agent acts based on isolated memory
  └──────────────┘
         ▼
  ┌──────────────┐
  │ Human Node   │ ← Pauses for human input when active
  └──────────────┘
```

**Memory Isolation (Asymmetric):**
- PC agents only see their own memories (strict isolation)
- DM agent sees all memories (enables dramatic irony and secrets)

## Dual Purpose

This project serves two complementary objectives:

1. **Entertainment** - Genuine D&D experience for players who can't coordinate groups
2. **Research** - Platform for studying emergent multi-agent narrative behavior

Full transcript logging enables research into:
- Narrative coherence across multiple LLMs
- Character differentiation and personality consistency
- Emergent callbacks and story development
