backstory: Whisper was orphaned young and raised by the monks of the Order of the
  Mantis in the mountains east of Qualinesti. Small and slight, she learned early
  that speed and misdirection beat brute force every time. When the Dragonarmies burned
  the monastery, she escaped through secret tunnels the elder monks had prepared.
  Now she wanders Ansalon with nothing but her fists, her wits, and an unshakeable
  belief that the world is still worth saving — even if it takes a few well-placed
  kicks to prove it.
