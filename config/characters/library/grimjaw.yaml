backstory: Grimjaw was the champion of a northern mountain clan until a rival warlord
  destroyed his village while he was away on a hunt. He carries the broken tusk of
  his clan's totem bear as a reminder. Now he wanders south, selling his axe to any
  worthy cause while secretly searching for the warlord who took everything from him.
