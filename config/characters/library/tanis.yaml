backstory: A half-elf raised in the borderlands between human and elven territories,
  never fully accepted by either. Tanis swore an oath to protect those caught between
  worlds — refugees, orphans, the displaced. His oath was tested when his home village
  was destroyed by draconian raiders, leaving him the sole survivor. He carries a
  battered shield with his village's crest scratched into the metal.

name: Tanis
personality: A conflicted leader torn between duty and compassion. Tanis speaks with
  quiet authority but constantly second-guesses himself in private. He leads from
  the front, taking hits meant for others. He has a dry, self-deprecating humor that
  surfaces in the worst moments. Fiercely protective of the innocent, especially refugees
  and the displaced. Distrusts institutions but believes deeply in personal honor.
