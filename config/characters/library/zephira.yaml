backstory: Born with wild magic surging through her veins, Zephira was taken in by
  the Arcanum Collective as a child after accidentally setting her family's farm ablaze.
  She excelled in theoretical magic but her unpredictable power made her a liability.
  After a surge destroyed half a laboratory, she was politely asked to leave. Now
  she adventures to learn control through practice, documenting every magical phenomenon
  she encounters in her ever-growing journal.
