backstory: Dorn served twenty years in the armies of Solamnia before the Dragonarmies
  swept across the land. He watched his company fall at the Battle of the Plains,
  and he alone survived by sheer stubborn refusal to die. Now a wandering sellsword
  with a battered longsword and a shield bearing the faded crest of his fallen company,
  he seeks purpose beyond mere survival. He fights not for glory or gold, but because
  fighting is the only thing he knows how to do well.

name: Dorn
personality: Grizzled veteran soldier who has seen too many wars. Pragmatic and direct,
  with a dry gallows humor. Fiercely loyal to those who earn his trust but slow to
  give it. Prefers actions over words and judges people by what they do, not what
  they say.
